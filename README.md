# Capstones


## Capstone 2
I would like to continue examining educational data. 



## Capstone 1
All of the below data sets come from the California Deparment of Education Data and Statistics Division, https://www.cde.ca.gov/ds/. For this capstone, I would like to become familiar with education data sets and better understand how to analyze them. As a California native who volunteers at a high school, I hope to draw upon my time as a student and as a sports coach to better inform my understanding of these data sets.

### Primary
**CA SAT scores for 2019-2020**  
**raw data**: http://www3.cde.ca.gov/researchfiles/satactap/sat20.txt  
**data layout**: https://www.cde.ca.gov/ds/sp/ai/reclayoutsat20.asp

I would like to compare % of students passing College Board benchmarks by county. Furthermore, I would conduct hypothesis tests to see if a certain county had a higher average of meeting benchmarks. 

### Secondary
**Droput rates for CA High Schools 2016-2017**  
**raw data**: http://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/dlfile/dlfile.aspx?cLevel=School&cYear=2016-17&cCat=Dropouts&cPage=filesdropouts  
**data layout**: https://www.cde.ca.gov/ds/ad/fsdropouts.asp

I would like to compare dropout rates by county, as well as when drop out rates are occuring (9th, 10th, 11th, or 12th). My hypothesis tests would focus on these rates. In addition, I would like to examine demographic information and any trends there. I would avoid conducting hypothesis tests on demographic information at this point in my data science career.


### Tertiary
**CA AP scores for 2019-2020**  
**raw data**: http://www3.cde.ca.gov/researchfiles/satactap/ap20.txt  
**data layout**: https://www.cde.ca.gov/ds/sp/ai/reclayoutap20.asp  

I would like to look at AP scores by county/high school. My hypothesis test would be the rate of getting a passing score (3 or higher). I would also be curious to examine demographic data of those who pass the test/don't pass the test.
